Simulations of the Kv7.4 channel in a plasma membrane model with [Martini 2.2 parameters](http://cgmartini.nl/index.php/224-m22) and the [GROMACS simulation program](https://www.gromacs.org).

Lipid composition is based on the plasma membrane model of [Ingólfsson et al. (2014)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ja507832e)

Studying how the protein interacts with the lipids and membrane biophysical properties.

# Binding of Sansanmycin analogues to the MurX enzyme 
![MurX](images/murx.png)
Simulations to investigate the binding of Sansanmycin antibiotic analogues to the MurX enzyme from *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*\
Yellow represents a hydrophobic patch of residues that is targetted by the Sansanmycin analogues. [Find out more here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c01407).

# Steered molecular dynamics simulations of the $\alpha2\beta4$ nAChR

![Alik_Poster](images/nicotine_figure.png)
Simulations were conducted to open the pore of the $\alpha2\beta4$ nAChR.\
The vectors for steering were calculated based on the $\alpha7$ nAChR structures by [Noviello et al. (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33735609/).
